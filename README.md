# Empathy-Level-Detection-with-Machine-Learning

Identifying and understanding empathy levels is important in many fields as it can lead to improved communication, collaboration, and outcome.nderstanding and expressing empathy is crucial for successful social interactions, especially when it comes to individuals with movement impairments. To improve social interactions with this group, a study was conducted with 60 perticipants to identify empathy levels using machine learning techniques.Our study provides a proof of concept for using wearable 
eye-tracking data and machine learning models to identify and classify empathy levels, and highlights the potential for further research and application in various fields.
